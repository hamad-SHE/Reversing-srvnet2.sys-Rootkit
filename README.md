# nvraid-rootkit

## Overview
This repository contains obfuscated and unobfuscated code segments related to the `nvraid-rootkit`. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate techniques for reversing obfuscation, aiding in understanding and analyzing malicious rootkits. By showcasing both versions of the code, the project highlights the steps involved in deobfuscation and the underlying mechanisms in the rootkit's operations.

## Contents
- **Obfuscated Code**: The original code in its obfuscated state, as encountered during the reverse engineering process.
- **Deobfuscated Code**: A cleaned, readable version of the code after applying deobfuscation techniques. This version is more accessible and demonstrates the rootkit's functionality in a clear format.

## Purpose
The deobfuscation process not only aids in understanding the code but also serves as an educational resource for those studying reverse engineering techniques. Analyzing the deobfuscated code reveals core functionalities often hidden by obfuscation, such as:

- System manipulation capabilities
- Persistence mechanisms
- Unauthorized access methods

## Use Case
This repository serves as a resource for those interested in:

- **Reverse Engineering**: Understanding the techniques used in deobfuscation.
- **Rootkit Analysis**: Gaining insights into typical rootkit behavior and implementation.
